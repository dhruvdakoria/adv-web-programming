Question 3		50 / 50 points
Create a website that can be run by opening a file called index.html in the browser (i.e. no backend). 

The website should have a form styled with Twitter Bootstrap.  The form should have three input textboxes and labels for: city, country, colour.  The form should have two buttons: submit and default.  Submit should be styled as a primary button, default should be styled as an info button.  (20 marks)

When the user clicks on the default button, the city, country and colour input textboxes should be populated with the following data respectively: Hamilton, Canada, orange.  (10 marks)

When the user clicks on the submit button, basic form validation should take place with the results reported below the form.  If the contents of the city input textbox are less than 5 characters in length, then the validation message "City input not long enough" should appear in the results.  If the contents of the country input textbox are more than 12 characters in length, then the validation message "Country input is too long" should appear in the results.  If both validation issues are present, then both messages should appear.  If neither validation issue is present, the message "Successful form submission" should appear in the results, and the text color of this message should be set to the same colour as found in the colour input text box (you can assume it's either a basic text color like red, orange, etc, or a color code like #78F45B).   The form results content should reflect the last submission of the form only.  (20 marks)
